### CSCU9B2

The code within this repository is designed and developed in line with the
practicals for the first year course at the University of Stirling.

## Prerequisites
As this is a scripted language problem, you do not require anything to be
installed, except the web browser of your choice (of course).

## Folder Structure
So the weekly practicals are found in the folder aptly named ***pages***
and you will able to follow each week from here. The ***redhat*** folder
was part of one of the practicals.

## Assignment Folder
In this assignment we were tasked with creating a small website to ensure
that we had a basic understanding of HTML. You will find some basic code
here. Very basic.
